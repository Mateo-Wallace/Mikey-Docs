# MarkDown Tutorial

## Heading

To make a heading using markdown you must simply use a `#` sign.

```
# H1
## H2
### H3
All the way down to ###### H6
```

### Example Heading

For example, the example heading above was written with `### Example Heading`

## Bold

To **bold** text use two asterisks on either side of your input.

```
**This text is bold**
```

**This text is bold**

Similar alternatives to **bold** are `code` and _italics_ and [links]()

See: [code](), [italic](#italic), [links]()

To *italicize* text use one asterisks on either side of your input or an underscore.

```
*This text is italics*
_This text is also italicized_
```

*This text is italics*

_This text is also italicized_
